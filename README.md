# Maze
Algorithms for generating a random nxm maze and finding its fastest exit route.

[2024 UPDATE] - i revitalized this program, as i had different broken projects of it in my hard disk, and no way to make it run.
I managed to make it work by putting all the code together. It's pretty shitty! But it was a fond memory and i was pretty happy when i managed to get it back to work again.
